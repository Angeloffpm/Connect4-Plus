# Connect4-Plus
The classic Connect-4 game with a twist! Each player gets 3 new powerups to use once a game! A power up to destroy an entire row, column, or 3x3 square on the board.

This project was developed as a final project in one of my courses. It was developed using the Qt framework, and C++ programming.
